    <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p>
        SyncWork aims to provide a comprehensive platform for freelancers and clients to seamlessly collaborate on projects. 
        The platform will not only offer a repository of valuable data on freelancers and the gig economy but will also serve 
        as a collaboration tool for freelancers working together on complex projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, no single platform offers a complete solution for multi-freelancer collaboration, payment management, 
        and AI-driven matching of skills to project requirements. SyncWork intends to bridge this gap by offering an 
        intuitive interface with rich functionality.

        <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> - Database for storing freelancer data</li>
        <li><strong>NLP with spaCy</strong> - AI for matching freelancers to projects based on skillset</li>
        <li><strong>Socket.io</strong> - Real-time collaboration tools for multiple freelancers</li>
        <li><strong>PayPal API</strong> - Secure payment processing between clients and freelancers</li>

        The design of SyncWork will prioritize user experience, ensuring both freelancers and clients can interact 
        with the platform effortlessly. The use of real-time collaboration tools, along with AI-driven project matching, 
        will differentiate SyncWork from existing freelancing platforms.
